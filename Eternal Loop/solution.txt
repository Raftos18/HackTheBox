After creating a script to unzip files
until we find a file that cannot be unzipped 
we get to the last zip 6969.zip

We use fcrackzip with rockyou.txt and get password "pleaseletmein"
if we open the final file with vscode or some other editor we see
a db file. Searching for the HTB keyword gets us the flag.
