- robots.txt had some intresting info, also we may have confirmation that /admin-dir has contacts and creds *
    User-agent: *

    # This folder contains personal contacts and creds, so no one -not even robots- should see it - waldo (NOTE: 'waldo' could be a user)
    Disallow: /admin-dir

/contacts.txt (Status: 200)
/credentials.txt (Status: 200)


using the ftp user from the credentials.txt is succesful
the same creds seem to work for ssh according to hydra but when connecting 
over ssh the connection is closed immidiatly

Someone said this:
Actually, is not the creds that has a typo. The p*p file you need is something beween
the name of the machine and the r*****.t** directory.
Just no "-". This might be a spoiler, but it was the strangest part of the box. 
PM me for more (as far as I have reached ofc)


The list to use is /dirb/big.txt
and the admin page is most propably adminer.php



You are definitely on the right track I am guessing you came to the conclusion of Adminer from a Google search of the boxes name. 
There are tons of rabbit holes in the zip file to throw you off however, it is a backup, and backups tell you a lot about how a developer has structured their site. 
So continue your enumeration as normal but think about which directory would be the most interesting poke around at. 
I think I am basically spoiling it at this point but let me know if you have anymore questions.
