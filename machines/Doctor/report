-- Adding doctors.htb to hosts and visiting gets me a log in page

-- I registed a new user, got message 'Your account has been created, with a time limit of twenty minutes!'

-- Enumarating directories we get an odd looking /archive dir. The web page appears empty
but uppon inspecting the source code we can see the messages we post appear there 

-- Testing for Server Side Template Injection on the message. As the back end is built
on Python (we can verify that from looking are the responses we get in burp) Jinja2 is
the template engine we test. 

-- At first glance the injection ({{7 * 7}} seems to have failed but if we take a look 
a look at the archive page thought the page source we can see that it works.


-- Next step is to create a reverse shell. Following the https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection on Jinja2 we came up with 
a working reverse shell payload

-- Downloaded the database and found admin users password hashed. Will try to crack!


-- Running linpeas and scanning the results we get some info on shaun and what looks like
a password 'Guitar123'

-- su shaun with the password gets us in


-- Running the command curl -k -u shaun:Guitar123 https://localhost:8089/services/messages
proves we can use splank commands as user shaun. Lets try to use it to escalate to root


-- Following https://github.com/tevora-threat/splunk_local_privesc/blob/master/spelunker.sh and changing the script a bit give us root access
