== Hacking into "Nest" ==

* Running a port scan on the 1000 most popular ports *
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/nest 10.10.10.178

445/tcp which is the port for Samba is found open


* Also runing a nmap scan on all the available ports *
nmap -p- 10.10.10.178

4386/tcp is also found open but it is unknown what it is used for

* Using smbmap we see we have access to some directories and files, we also see some users *
smbmap -u " " -p " " -d "htb.local" -H 10.10.10.178

* Doing a bit of searching with smbmap i found a welcome email, that contains creds for TempUser *
Username: TempUser
Password: welcome2019


* Using TempUser i have access to more data, one thing i noticed was the RU_config.xml 
which contains creds for another users *

<Username>c.smith</Username>
<Password>fTEzAfYDoz1YzkqhQkH6GQFYKp1XY5hm7bjOP86yYxE=</Password>


* Apperently with a bit of luck when i pasted the encrypted password on Google 
it delivered a page in which some had decrypted it already, lucky i guess*

password: xRxRxPANCAK3SxRxRx

* The correct way would be to notice in the notepad++ config there were some changes in the dir of 
IT\Carl. There the file Utils.vb could be found that contained the decryption methods required 
for the password *

password: xRxRxPANCAK3SxRxRx


* Found the 'Debug Mode Password.txt' which appeared empty from linux but using 'smbclient allinfo' on the file
to reveal hidden attributes and then 'smbclient get "Debug Mode Password.txt":"Password" got me the password *
password: WBQ201953D8w


* Also downloaded a "HqkLdap.exe", which might be what's running on port 4386???, a quick look with string gave me*
PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089

* Using telnet -4 10.10.10.178 4386 we connect to port 4386 which runs some kind of software, running the help command
brings some other options *

LIST
SETDIR <Directory_Name>
RUNQUERY <Query_ID>
DEBUG <Password>
HELP <Command>

* Running the debug command with password: WBQ201953D8w, changes to debug mode, gives extra options *
SERVICE
SESSION
SHOWQUERY <Query_ID>

* Setting the dir to "C:\Program Files\HQK\LDAP" and running SHOWQUERY 2 ruturns the encrypted Administrator password *
User=Administrator
Password=yyEq0Uvvhq2uQOcWG8peLoeRQehqip/fKdeG/kjEVb4=

NOTES: It is possible that the same or similar encryption algorithm was used for this password as the first we decrypted!


!!! Need to actually do the disasembly on HqkLdap !!!
